    "as a motor end plate. Cardiac muscle fibers are connected by intercalated discs to from a functional syncytium, which transmits depolarization waves across the cell membranes. Smooth muscle consists of tightly packed small cells that conduct depolarization waves over their membranes. Once stimulated, by either nervous impulse or stretching, smooth muscle cells exert slow, sustained contractions that are very slow to fatigue. It is important to remember that the physical muscle contraction that can be observed follows the electrical signal to the muscle to contract.In this laboratory, several experimental procedures will be used to investigate the different contraction characteristics of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle. The effects of the neurotransmitters, acetylcholine and norepinephrine, on the rates of contraction of cardiac and smooth muscle will be examined. "

    "Muscle physiology is a branch of physiology that studies the mechanism behind muscle contraction. Muscle contraction is shortening of the muscle fibers initiated by action potentials in motor neurons which cause the release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles. Muscle tissue is characterized by properties that allow movement. Muscle cells are excitable; they respond to a stimulus. They are contractile, meaning they can shorten and generate a pulling force. When attached between two movable objects, such as two bones, contraction of the muscles cause the bones to move."

    "Conclusion The characteristics of muscle tissue are categorized based on their appearance and control (either skeletal, cardiac, or smooth or visceral muscle tissue), functionally as voluntary or involuntary, and also structurally as either striated or smooth.Muscle physiology is a branch of physiology that studies the mechanism behind muscle contraction. Muscle contraction is shortening of the muscle fibers initiated by action potentials in motor neurons which cause the release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles. Muscle contraction entails the sliding of the thin filaments past the thick filaments, resulting in shortening of the sarcomere and, thus, the entire myocyte. The resulting longitudinal force is transmitted through the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the bone via the tendon."
