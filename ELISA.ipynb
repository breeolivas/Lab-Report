    "The purpose of this lab is to use a laboratory technique to be able to detect the presence of any specific antibodies, antigens, or other substances in a biological sample. The test it's primarily used in medical diagnostics to identify the presence of antibodies associated with various infectious diseases. The test could also determine whether an individual has developed antibodies in response to a infection or vaccine. The ELISA involves a binding of antibodies or antigens to a solid surface such as a microplate. Overall, the ELISA test is used in the medical field to be able to detect antibodies ."

We got a reaction from the three positive control microplate strip it turned into a sky blue meaning that there is a presence of antigen-antibody complex. Turning blue in the positive control is normal it's also normal for a red color for the negative control however ours had no reaction."
