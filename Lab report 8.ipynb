    "Hormones are chemical messengers that are secreted directly into the blood by endocrine glands. Target tissues are distinguished by having specific receptor sites in their cell membranes, and sometimes in the cytoplasm, which only bind with specific hormones.This low rate of transport results in excess accumulation of glucose in the blood, called hyperglycemia. An excess of insulin causes a decrease in the level of blood glucose or hypoglycemia. When insulin is deficient and the cells cannot metabolize glucose for energy, the cells compensate by increasing their metabolism of fats and proteins. In diagnosing for diabetes mellitus, several tests are used to determine as precisely a possible what metabolic error is causing the disease. Such tests are urinary glucose level, urinary ketone bodies, fasting blood glucose level, insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance tests. In this laboratory, we will be using the glucose tolerance test.\n",

    "Six student volunteers will be selected for this experiment. These subjects should report to the lab in the fasted state not having eaten for 10-12 hours. Each student’s normal fasting blood glucose level will be determined using the test strips for the glucometer assigned to each student. Each volunteer will clean a finger with 70% alcohol, then use a sterile lancet to obtain a drop of blood for the test. If a student is helping another obtain a blood sample, gloves and universal precautions will be followed. Each subject will then drink a lemon flavored solution (Tru-Glu) of 25% glucose. The quantity of solution will be based on 1 g of glucose per kilogram of body weight. To determine body weight in kilograms, the weight in pounds will be divided by 2.2. After ingesting the glucose, the subject will repeat the blood testing procedures every 30 minutes. Testing will continue in this manner for 1 1/2 hours or until the end of the lab period. Record and graph the average of the class results of the blood glucose tests. Compare the results with the normal glucose tolerance test curve. Describe the graphs\n",
